Problem
A company conducted a coding test to hire candidates. NN candidates appeared for the test, and each of them faced MM problems. Each problem was either unsolved by a candidate (denoted by 'U'), solved partially (denoted by 'P'), or solved completely (denoted by 'F').

To pass the test, each candidate needs to either solve XX or more problems completely, or solve (X-1)(X−1) problems completely, and YY or more problems partially.

Given the above specifications as input, print a line containing NN integers. The i^{th}i 
th
  integer should be 11 if the i^{th}i 
th
  candidate has passed the test, else it should be 00.

Input:
The first line of the input contains an integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, NN and MM, denoting the number of candidates who appeared for the test, and the number of problems in the test, respectively.
The second line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, XX and YY, as described above, respectively.
The next NN lines contain MM characters each. The j^{th}j 
th
  character of the i^{th}i 
th
  line denotes the result of the i^{th}i 
th
  candidate in the j^{th}j 
th
  problem. 'F' denotes that the problem was solved completely, 'P' denotes partial solve, and 'U' denotes that the problem was not solved by the candidate.
Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing NN integers. The i^{th}i 
th
  integer denotes the result of the i^{th}i 
th
  candidate. 11 denotes that the candidate passed the test, while 00 denotes that he/she failed the test.

Explanation:
Sample Test 1: There are 44 candidates and 55 problems. Each candidate needs to solve 33 or more problems completely, or 22 problems completely and 22 or more problems partially. Only the first and the second candidates satisfy this.

Sample Test 2: The candidates need to either solve at least one problem completely, or they need to solve three or more problems partially. Only candidates 11 and 33 satisfy this.

Sample Test 3: The candidate needs to either solve two or more problems completely, or solve at least one problems completely and two problems partially. The candidate does not satisfy this.
