The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using to read input data is sufficiently fast to handle problems branded with the enormous Input/Output warning. You are expected to be able to process at least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.

Input
The input begins with two positive integers n k (n, k<=107). The next n lines of input contain one positive integer ti, not greater than 109, each.

Output
Write a single integer to output, denoting how many integers ti are divisible by k.

Example
Input:
7 3
1
51
966369
7
9
999996
11

Output:
4

// Remember that the class name should be "Main" and should be "public".
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// System.in and System.out are input and output streams, respectively.
		InputStream inputStream = System.in;

		InputReader in = new InputReader(inputStream);

		int n = in.nextInt();
		int k = in.nextInt();
		
		int ans = 0;
		
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			int x = in.nextInt();
			
			if (x % k == 0) {
				ans++;
			}
		}

		System.out.println(ans);
	}
